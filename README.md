# UA Little Rock Cyber Gym

The UA Little Rock Cyber Gym provides a hands-on cybersecurity lab environment fully built and managed in your personal Google cloud project. Once deployed, instructors have access to custom-built workouts in the catalog below or they can create their own workouts using yaml specifications. An instructor initiates a system build for the number of students in their class. The build takes roughly 5-10 minutes, and the instructor can then send out an individually generated link for each student. Then students have access to independently manage their workouts. All cloud costs are managed through cloud functions to automatically shut down and delete workout resources.
