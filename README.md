# UA Little Rock Cyber Gym

The UA Little Rock Cyber Gym provides a hands-on cybersecurity lab environment fully built and managed in the  Google cloud. Once deployed, instructors have access to custom-built workouts in the catalog below or they can create their own workouts using yaml specifications. When ready, an instructor initiates a system build for the number of students in their class. The build takes roughly 5-10 minutes, and the instructor can then send out an individually generated link for each student. From here students have access to independently turn their workout on and off (Throughout this document, we use the term workout to refer to a cybersecurity lab).
