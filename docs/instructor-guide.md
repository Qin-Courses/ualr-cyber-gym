## Building a Workout or Arena

![Building a Workout or Arena](/images/instructions-instructor-build.png)
You as an instructor have access to build specified workouts and arenas. The links to build the workouts should be provided or developed by you. A workout or arena is simply a document specifying how to build each lab environment in the cloud.

The form simply accepts the number of students in your course the length of time you want to keep the workout or arena available. When you click to build, all of the information necessary to build labs for each of your students is packaged and kicked off. In a few seconds, you will be directed to your instructor management page for the requested build. However, keep in mind, the build will take several minutes to complete. It may take up to 15 minutes for everything to be ready for the students.

**What is the difference between a workout and an arena?** A workout means each student has their own isolated network, whereas arenas allow all students to reside in the same network.

## Managing Each Workout or Arena

Soon after building a workout or arena, the application will direct you to a page with all of the requested workouts as shown below. Although the student labs are allocated very quickly, it may still take 10-20 minutes for the actual cloud resources to build. You can still send these links out to the students in the meantime.

For workouts or arenas having teacher instructions, you can access that through the link provided as shown above.

Click on each student entry to see their workout information. Here you can perform the following functions:

1.  **Landing Page** - This will be a link made specifically for each student. Hover over _Landing Page_ to obtain the custom link, and copy and paste that into an email for the student.

2.  **Assessment** - Some workouts and arenas come with built-in assessments. For these, students will go through their instructions and submit their assessments. You can see the results of the assessment in this listing.

3.  **Change Student Name -** For your convenience, you may change the studentâ€™s name to make the workouts or arenas easier to track.
